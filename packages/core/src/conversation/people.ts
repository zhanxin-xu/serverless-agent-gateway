/**

 * "@#3B6834" in its messages becomes a mention of the person it names.
 *
 * People are told apart by their short id ("#3B6834", what the agent knows
 * them by), so senders logged before messages kept the full platform id still
 * count: their label carries the short id and the nickname. Only people with a
 * known platform id can really be mentioned.
